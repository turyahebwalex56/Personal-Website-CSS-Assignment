  <li> <strong>Sports: </strong>  It doesn’t matter what sport you do. Exercising in general develops self-discipline, patience, and helps bounce back from disappointment. Team sports create opportunities to improve leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills, too.</li>
  <li> <strong>Music:</strong>  Listening to gospel music revives my soul as it revives my faith.</li>
  <li>  <strong> Volunteering and social causes:</strong> I like reaching out to the needy people who are in suffering; most especially the youths. I normally do this via church evagelism programs and outreach projects.</li>
  <li>  <strong> Reading:</strong> By reading books about protagonists who have overcome challenges, we are oftentimes encouraged to do the same. The right book can motivate you to never give up and stay positive, regardless of whether it’s a romance novel or a self-help book.</li>
  <li>  <strong> Technology: </strong>I love exploring the latest techologies  trending worldwide.</li>
  <li> <strong> Photography:  </strong> Photography is so much more than just taking pictures. It develops conceptual skills and technical expertise, but also teaches how to collaborate with others. </li>
